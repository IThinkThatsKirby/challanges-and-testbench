### Your message is a string containing space separated words.
### You need to encrypt each word in the message using the following rules:
    The first letter must be converted to its ASCII code.
    The second letter must be switched with the last letter
#### Keepin' it simple: There are no special characters in the input.

## Examples:
```go
EncryptThis("Hello") == "72olle"
EncryptThis("Hello") == "72olle"
EncryptThis("good") == "103doo"
EncryptThis("hello world") == "104olle 119drlo"
```
